Fox 2: SceneKit
============

This sample code demonstrates the following Scene Kit features that were added in iOS 11, tvOS 11, and macOS 10.13:

- Camera constraints define the camera behaviour of the app/game
- A new physically-based depth of field effect achieved with “bokeh”
- Screen space GPU tessellation (using Pixar’s openSubdiv)
- Animation of character tones using a new animation engine (and API)
- Cascaded shadow maps
- GameplayKit integration
